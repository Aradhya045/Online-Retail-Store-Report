To complete the Tata Simulation of Data Analyst Program tasks using DAX functions in Power BI and Excel for data cleaning and modification, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Data Preparation in Excel

1. **Load the Data:**
   - Import the dataset into Excel.
   - Ensure all columns are properly named and formatted (e.g., date columns as dates, numeric columns as numbers).

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Remove any unnecessary columns.
   - Handle missing values by either filling them with appropriate values or removing the rows if they are insignificant.
   - Ensure there are no duplicates.

3. **Create Helper Columns:**
   - Add columns for the year and month if they are not already present.
   - Use formulas to extract the year and month from the date column.

4. **Save the Cleaned Data:**
   - Save the cleaned and modified dataset as a CSV or Excel file.

### Step 2: Import Data into Power BI

1. **Import the Data:**
   - Open Power BI Desktop.
   - Import the cleaned data file.

### Step 3: Create Measures and Visualizations in Power BI

#### Question 1: Time Series of Revenue for 2011 by Month

1. **Create a New Measure for Revenue:**
   ```DAX
   TotalRevenue = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])
   ```

2. **Filter Data for the Year 2011:**
   - Use a slicer to filter the data for the year 2011.

3. **Create a Line Chart:**
   - Axis: Month.
   - Values: TotalRevenue.
   - Add the year filter to only show data for 2011.

#### Question 2: Top 10 Countries by Revenue (Excluding UK)

1. **Create Measures for Revenue and Quantity Sold:**
   ```DAX
   TotalRevenue = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])
   TotalQuantity = SUM('Sales'[Quantity])
   ```

2. **Create a Visual for Top 10 Countries:**
   - Create a table or bar chart.
   - Filter out the United Kingdom using visual-level filters.
   - Use the measures `TotalRevenue` and `TotalQuantity`.

3. **Sort and Filter:**
   - Sort the chart by TotalRevenue.
   - Use a top N filter to show only the top 10 countries.

#### Question 3: Top 10 Customers by Revenue

1. **Create a Measure for Customer Revenue:**
   ```DAX
   CustomerRevenue = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])
   ```

2. **Create a Bar Chart:**
   - Axis: CustomerID (or CustomerName if available).
   - Values: CustomerRevenue.
   - Sort the chart by CustomerRevenue in descending order.
   - Apply a top N filter to show only the top 10 customers.

#### Question 4: Demand by Region (Excluding UK)

1. **Create a Measure for Demand:**
   ```DAX
   TotalDemand = SUM('Sales'[Quantity])
   ```

2. **Create a Map or Matrix Visual:**
   - Use a map visual if geographic data is available, or a matrix visual to show regions and their respective demand.
   - Exclude the United Kingdom using visual-level filters.
   - Use the `TotalDemand` measure for the values.

### Step 4: Customize and Format Visuals

1. **Format Charts:**
   - Ensure all charts have proper titles, axis labels, and legends.
   - Use appropriate colors to differentiate data points.

2. **Add Tooltips:**
   - Add custom tooltips to show additional information when hovering over data points.

3. **Create a Dashboard:**
   - Arrange all visuals on a single dashboard.
   - Ensure the dashboard is clean, with no need to scroll or hover to see critical information.

### Step 5: Publish and Share

1. **Publish the Dashboard:**
   - Publish the Power BI report to the Power BI service.
   - Share the dashboard with relevant stakeholders.

By following these steps, you can effectively complete the tasks using DAX functions in Power BI and Excel for data cleaning and modification. This will provide the CEO and CMO with the required insights to make informed decisions.
